I wanted to see if the same horizonatal line effects would happen for a different image than 
the mountains one I started with. I used a new image, this time of snowy mountains I took last
January to see what the same process might look like. 

It did have a similar effect as earlier, streaking the image horizontally (see snow2.jpeg).

I'd been reading about Direct Cosine Transformations (DCTs), and since I couldn't seem to 
reason out a pattern to the maddness, I sized the image quality down significantly, reducing
its number of pixels. 

I did a similar pixel replacement methon on small-snow-1.jpeg, and was pleased to see the 
effects of the DCT when the pixels were so much larger in comparison to the whole image.

And then, with small-snow-2.jpg, I added to thte size of the file by randomly frequently
adding the hex value "20202020 20202020 206C6F76 65202020 20202020 20202020", which looks like
"         love           " in ASCII (the spaces to help me find my edits easier).

While I liked the look of both abstractions, it felt like it was still random and hard to control.
I went back to the drawing board and read a lot from other glitch artists. In one youtube 
tutorial, I learned that the horizontal streak effect often occurs because the image isn't 
big enough. With really large images (and thus super tiny pixels), the effects appear really
different. I didn't have any images the size the video suggested, so I attempted to size up an 
image I already had that was pretty big.
