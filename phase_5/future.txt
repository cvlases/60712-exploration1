In the future, I want to...
- Learn `ffmpeg` command line tool for image/video manipulation
- Explore more systematic approaches now that manual intuition is developed
- Investigate why different viewers render glitched images so differently
- Experiment with video files using similar techniques
- Develop more efficient workflows for manual manipulation
